### Authorization
When you enter the application, an authorization window appears, in which you must click the "Standard connection" button, after which a dialog box will open for creating, saving or selecting a connection. Click the question mark button to view detailed connection information. To add a new connection, you need to enter the connection name and URL, and then click the "Save" button. To delete a connection, you need to click the trash can button on the right side of the connection. After selecting a connection, the label on the button will change to the name of the selected connection. It should be noted that the connections are saved in the device memory.
